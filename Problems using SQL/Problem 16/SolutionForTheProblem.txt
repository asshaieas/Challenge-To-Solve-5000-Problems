Notes & Tips:
✅ Purpose: This query retrieves unique city names from the STATION table that do not start or end with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U).
✅ Use of LOWER(): Ensures case insensitivity while checking the first and last letter.
✅ NOT LIKE operator: Used to filter out cities that match the specified patterns.
✅ DISTINCT: Ensures that duplicate city names are removed from the result set.
