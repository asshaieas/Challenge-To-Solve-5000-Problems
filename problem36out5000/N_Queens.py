# 📌 Problem: N-Queens (LeetCode #51)
# 🎯 Objective: Place 'n' queens on an 'n x n' chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.
# 👨‍💻 Approach: Backtracking + Validation with Pruning

# 🔍 Complexity Analysis:
# Time Complexity: O(N!) — because we try N possibilities, and backtrack with pruning
# Space Complexity: O(N^2) — for the board + recursive stack
